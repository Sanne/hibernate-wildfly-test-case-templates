# Hibernate WildFly Test Case Templates

When trying to reproduce an issue for a project involving hibernate deployed in WildFly or EAP, in order to spot if the root cause of the issue comes from Hibernate it's extremely helpful to have a test case that does involve only Hibernate with all the configuration settings toggled on as WildFly/EAP does.  

The aim of this project is to help to create such a test cases.
